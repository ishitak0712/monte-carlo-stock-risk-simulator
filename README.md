# 📈 Monte Carlo Stock Return Simulator

This project explores the use of **Monte Carlo simulation** to model possible future return scenarios for the S&P 500 based on historical data. By simulating thousands of one-year price paths, it estimates the **distribution of outcomes**, evaluates **investment risk**, and quantifies the **likelihood of achieving certain return thresholds**. The goal is to demonstrate how probabilistic modelling can help investors think beyond simple forecasts and make decisions with a clearer understanding of potential outcomes.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Use historical log returns to simulate future stock price paths
- Visualise the distribution of return scenarios and estimate risk
- Quantify the probability of gains or losses over a 1-year horizon
- Demonstrate a data-driven approach to understanding market uncertainty

## 📊 Why This Project?

In financial decision-making, relying on a single outcome or average return can be misleading. This project was created to explore a more nuanced, probability-based perspective. It reflects how investors and analysts can use simulation techniques to better understand **downside risk**, **expected reward**, and the **range of outcomes** that real markets can produce.

The project is also a hands-on application of concepts from portfolio theory and quantitative finance, bridging foundational ideas with practical implementation in Python.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I built this project to explore how uncertainty in financial markets can be quantified and visualised using statistical modelling. Rather than relying on single-point predictions, Monte Carlo simulation offers a way to see the full range of possible outcomes — which is crucial for sound investment thinking.

This was also an opportunity to deepen my understanding of portfolio risk, return distributions, and how volatility impacts investment decisions over time. The project aligns with my broader interest in applying data science to real-world financial questions in a clear, interpretable way.
